# Hey there ! Please let me guide you in this messy repo..ðŸš€ 


The first 4 projects you see are writen in **python** and they  are about :

  -data cleaning and basic EDA using pandas
  
  -building machine learning models.


More spesifically , the SPACE-X project is a classification problem ,whereas the car price prediction is a regression problem


The PortofolioProject is a classic BI dashboard devoloped in **Power BI** , showcasing YTD metrics using multiple vizuals. 

And lastly ,the CoffeeOrdersProject is a dynamic dashboard developed in **Excel** .In this project I used a lot of lookups to bring all the necessary data to one table and dynamic pivot tables to create the charts .
